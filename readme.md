This repo contains a couple of documents that were used during the implementation of added mass for the Gazebo simulator (https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sim/issues/1462). The documents are:

 - A [short document](docs/added_mass_transformations.pdf), with a derivation of the equations to convert a spatial inertia matrix from one point to another.

 - A [jupyter notebook](notebooks/Added%20Mass%20Motions.ipynb), with an implementation of the equations of motion for an arbitrary spatial inertia matrix.
